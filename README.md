# 2022-JD-Data-Management-Applications
**Course Description**
Students will learn how to create simple to complex SELECT queries including subqueries and joins, and students will also learn how to use SQL to update and delete data. Topics covered in this course include exposure to MySQL; developing physical schemas; creating and modifying databases, tables, views, foreign keys/primary keys (FKs/PKs), and indexes; populating tables; and developing simple Select-From-Where (SFW) queries to complex 3+ table join queries.

**Final Project Scenario - Scenario**
You are a database designer and developer who has been hired by two local businesses, Nora’s Bagel Bin and Jaunty Coffee Co., to build databases to help them manage their businesses. First, you will design a normalized physical database model to store data for Nora’s Bagel Bin’s ordering system. Then, you will use an existing database design document for Jaunty Coffee Co. to create its database. Once the tables have been built, you will load them with sample data and create a view and an index to protect and improve query performance. Finally, you will create both a simple query and a more complex table joins query to produce meaningful reports from the newly created database.
